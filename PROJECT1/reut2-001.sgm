<TITLE>TAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKERS EXCHANGE RATE PLEA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing
orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Textile Federation said.
    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
associations last Saturday the government could not fix the
Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to
U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold
the exchange rate at that level.
    The federation said in its request that many local textile
exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
business if the rate continued to fall.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's state-owned &lt;Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro - BNL> said it would issue 120 mln dlrs of five-year
convertible eurobonds, an operation to be lead-managed by
&lt;Credit Suisse-First Boston Ltd>.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference that the
issue, to be placed on the main international markets and
listed in Luxembourg, would be the first equity linked issue by
an Italian bank on the Euromarket.
    BNL officials said the issue is scheduled for mid-March and
additional financial details were not immediately available.
    They said the operation would be through the issue of
depositary receipts by BNL's London branch. They said the bonds
would carry warrants issued by its &lt;Efibanca> subsidiary and
convertible into BNL saving shares within five years.
    The officials said a banking consortium led by Credit
Suisse-First Boston would at the same time arrange for the
private placing of an unspecified number of BNL savings shares
with foreign institutional investors.
    The operation was to further its aim of obtaining a listing
on foreign stock exchanges with a view to future capital
increases through ordinary share issues, they said.

has revised downward its previously reported fourth quarter and
year, ended October 31, results to reflect compensation expense
for employee stock options.
    The company said resolution of this disagreement with its
auditors came as a result of Securities and Exchange Commission
involvement. The company will amend its option-granting
procedure to conform to the SEC decision which will eliminate
future charges, it added.
    Transform said its fourth quarter profit was revised to
305,082 dlrs, or two cts a share, from the previously reported
580,955 dlrs, which left the company with a fiscal 1986 loss of
249,814 dlrs, or two cts a share, instead of the reported
26,195 dlrs profit.

<TITLE>UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported
improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
&lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

<TITLE>CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
    The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
    "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
    "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
    "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added.
    The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
    He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.

said after the release of a sharply lower January leading
indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed.
    "The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net
exports," he said in a statement after the department reported
the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest
drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984.
    The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct
December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for
plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kenyan economy is heading for
difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
    In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
    The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
1985, he added.
    "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
reserves during the year," he said.
    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
capital for the first time in its history, he added.
    "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
sources to finance our development," he said.
    "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of new single-family homes in
the United States fell 6.8 pct in January from December to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 716,000 units, the Commerce
Department said.
    The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1

    Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually
sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down
from 59,000 in January, 1986.
    The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct
below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted

94,000 dlrs in January a year ago.
    New homes available on the market in January totaled a
seasonally adjusted 362,000 units, unchanged from December and
equal to a 6.3 months' supply.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing
four information technology systems that will be led by today's
highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.
    The company said information management products will be
the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business
communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of
Kodak."
    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,
Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four
billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those
sales were independent, that company would rank among the top
100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.
    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications
campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's
commitment to the business and industrial sector.
    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the
information management systems unveilded today --
    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more
than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).
    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information
management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system
that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current
information management systems.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,
computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.
    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a
write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will
market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in
1988.
    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up
to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes
of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed
out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.
    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000
in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system 
allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,
including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,
fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to
sell in the 700,000 dlr range.
    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk
version which provides data storage and retrieval through a
disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing
2.6 gigabytes.
    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of
the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually
loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs
with deliveries beginning in mid-year.
    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with
the more powerful KIMS system 5000.
    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and
software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987
and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.

<TITLE>BANGOR HYDRO &lt;BANG> SEEKS RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGOR, Maine, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it
has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for
a two-stage base rate reduction.
    Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect
on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a
final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln
dlrs, or 9.7 pct.
    The company said lower federal income taxes and lower
capital costs prompted the filing.
    The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the
MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue
reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.
    Bangor Hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce
residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by April 1.
    The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its
fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1.
    Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset
much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some
customers' rates.

<TITLE>PHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast
earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
at their present parities.
    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
on currency movements.
    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
    The company said mainly this represented the premium the
group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
had taken over.
    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
having used more funds than generated by group operations,
mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares
in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular
Inc.

William Proxmire said modified legislation to help a federal
deposit insurance fund and prohibit new limited-service banks
and thrifts could be ready for a Senate vote in two to three
weeks.
    Proxmire said he agreed to demands from committee members
for a one-year moratorium on granting new business powers
sought by commercial banks to increase the bill's chances.
    In its new form, the bill would proscribe regulators from
granting new powers to banks, Proxmire told reporters after a
speech to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
    A vote on the bill by the committee is scheduled for
Thursday. If approved it will go to the full Senate.
    "I have spoken to the majority leader and he has agreed to
bring it up promptly on the Senate floor in two or three weeks,"
Proxmire told the thrift executives.
    The bill would recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp fund with 7.5 billion dlrs.
    It also would prohibit establishment of new nonbank banks
and nonthrift thrifts, so-called because they provide financial
services but do not meet the regulatory definition of both
making loans and receiving deposits.

seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of

    The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate

February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in
1987.
    Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct
in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in
the third quarter.
    Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in
the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8

western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two
nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said.
    Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and

    Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of

    The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow
cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two

    Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last
night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> DISCOUNTS TALK ON PAN AM &lt;PN> DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp chairman Robert Crandall,
denying industry speculation, said the company is not
interested in acquiring shuttle routes in the northeast region
of the U.S. from Pan Am Corp.
    But in remarks at a press conference announcing a major
aircraft order, he said AMR would be interested in certain
other Pan Am assets. But he noted that none had been made
available.
    Pan Am earlier today announced an order for 40 new aircraft
from Boeing Co &lt;BA> and &lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European
consortium, for an estimated 2.5 billion dlrs.
    AMR, the parent of American Airlines, has said it is not
interested in acquiring Pan Am as a whole and Crandall
reiterated that position today.
    "Assets are one thing, and companies are another," Crandall

Lavoro-BNL> said it is negotiating to buy a West German bank as
part of its foreign expansion policy.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference the Italian
bank was currently involved in talks but declined to name the
German institution.
    He said the takeover move could be seen as BNL's reply to
Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>, which entered the Italian market in
December 1986, with the purchase of BankAmerica &lt;BACN>
subsidiary &lt;Banca D'America e D'Italia>.
    Nesi said BNL had also approved a 200 mln dlr credit line
to the Soviet Union aimed at enabling Soviet companies to pay
for Italian imports. He gave no further details.
    BNL officials said the group had also decided to increase
its activities in the Soviet Union by opening a representative
office in Moscow this month through its subsidiary &lt;Sogecred>,
which specialises in Italian-Soviet trade.

enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase

System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at

rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> HOPES FOR FIVE-FOLD RISE IN EUROPEAN SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Carmaker General Motors hopes to
sell between 7,000 and 8,000 vehicles in Europe this year, a
five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-president
of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation told a news briefing.
    "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he said at
a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.
    "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in
Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later.
Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year.
    Fry said that at an average price of 13,000 dlrs, his
projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln
and 104 mln dlrs in Europe.
    GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500
vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the
then strong dollar, Fry said.
    All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the
United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were
in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The collapse of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the
immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the
customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.
    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation
offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee
imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A
bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).
    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach
agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not
immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the
coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.
    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)
this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Treasury official C. Fred
Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace
the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had
not worked.
    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major
countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they
would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct
intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and
other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute
for International Economics, said in a statement to a House
Banking subcommittee.
    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has
occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should
produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this
year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100
billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he
said.

<TITLE>SYRIA SAYS ISRAEL BLOCKS CITRUS EXPORT FROM GAZA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Syria has complained to the
United Nations that Israeli occupation authorities were
blocking the export of citrus fruit from the Gaza Strip to the
countries of the European Community, EC.
    In a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
published here today, Syrian U.N. charge d'affaires Abdul
Mou'men Al-Atassi said: "These measures threaten to create a
slump in citrus production, which constitutes the primary
source of income in the Gaza Strip....They are causing heavy
losses to farmers and all those working in the field of citrus
production and threaten to bring about economic disaster."
    The Syrian envoy said the Israel action was a violation of
the Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Charter and the "legitimacy of
the economic rights endorsed by the United Nations."
    The Gaza Strip, occupied by Egypt in the 1948 Arab-Israel
war, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>There was no evidence of winterkill
in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line
running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.
Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field
report.
    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of
delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall
because of dry conditions.
    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
last fall's late seeding, it said.
    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
report said.
    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage
under these conditions, they said.
    The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the
field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it
emerged from winter.

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's current account deficit widened
to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,

was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and
investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04
billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.
    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth
quarter of 1985.

a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter
quarter.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Corp said the fresh start
provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to
1987 earnings per share.
    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln
dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.
    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the
fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening
tax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes
into earnings.
    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline
gradually over the next four years, during which time
Continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.
    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to
have a significant impact on earnings.

<TITLE>BELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the
European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats
and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United
States.
    De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration
officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference
there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and
oils used in the 12 EC countries.
    But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because
there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will
be a compromise."
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United
States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and
access to community markets.
    De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone
its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to
cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was
made toward resolving differences with the United States.
    U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and
the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.
    He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal
with another controversial health proposal that would forbid
the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the
United States.
    De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be
resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.
    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change
slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a
few months later by the hormone rule.

<TITLE>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Loans and advances from the Dutch
central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at
12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2,
the central bank weekly return showed.
    The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion
guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of
interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in
the form of tax payments to the state.
    Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the
public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival
or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.
    Current money market rates are at 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct for
call money against 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 a week ago, and between
5-5/16 and 5-9/16 pct against 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 for one to 12
month periods, dealers said.
    The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion
guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared
with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added.
    They expect the money market shortage to continue around 12
billion guilders this week.
    The weekly return showed total Dutch gold and currency
reserves rose 11.3 mln guilders to 56.0 billion guilders.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Banking committee chairman
Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., called for caution in giving
savings associations forbearance in paying their debts as part
of a bill providing three billion dlrs in new capital for the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
    "We cannot let forbearance stretch to protect the
mismanaged or terminal cases that would serve to further drain
the FSLIC fund," St Germain said at the start of a hearing on
FSLIC legislation. "Forbearance must be designed to help the
well managed institution temporarily on hard times. It must not
be forgiveness for the speculators, the high flyers and the
fast buck artists."
    The use of forbearance for well-managed institutions was
endorsed at the hearing by Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner
L.L. Bowman, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and the Texas
Savings and Loan League.

its board approved plans to offer a stock option plan for its
cable television operators.
    The company said it will offer the options in exchange for
a commitment to operate the company's programs to a set number

five year extension option.
    If the operator agrees to the plan, they will receive
options to buy 10 dlrs worth of common stock for each cable
subscriber committed, or 20 dlrs per subscriber, if they agree
to run both programs, the company explained.
    The company said the option will vest over a five year
period at the rate of 20 pct per year.
    The company, which offered a similar program last year,
said the current one is directed for those who did not sign up
last year, and for new carriers of the company's home shopping
video shows.

<TITLE>U.S. SETS CORN DEFICIENCY PAYMENT HALF PIK CERTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The upcoming five-month deficiency
payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash
and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior
Agriculture Department official told Reuters.
    Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or
"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,
Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state
and county operations, said.
    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs
ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be
delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer
program, von Garlem said.
get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in
certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).
    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at
signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half
of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said
this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most
farmers got advance payments.
    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300
mln dlrs," he said.
    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had
resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "we
proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it."

<TITLE>FORD CANADA &lt;FC> PROFIT DOWN ON CHANGEOVER COST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OAKVILLE, Ontario, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd,
90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, said the earlier reported
decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover
costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant.
    Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter
results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product
program costs, partially offset by lower engine production.
    The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell
to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter
profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior
year.
    Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian
operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth
quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in
the prior year.
    Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from
its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in
1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to
18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of
4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985,
excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.
    Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent
company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion
dlrs.
    The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln
dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter
results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies,
cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were
partially offset by lower industry volumes.
    Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas
operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased
interest costs, the company said.
    Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share
of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said.
The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in
1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.
    Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car
and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were
Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986.

<TITLE>FIRESTONE &lt;FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has
notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its
Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire
plants on or before September 15.
    A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be
covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company
took in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    The company said it was notified by the union March one
that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City
tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other
plants. 
    Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of
its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers
for several months.
    Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding
it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to
work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of
the three tire plants, it added.
    Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants
in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being
designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master
agreement with the rubber workers.
    Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the
leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans
to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits
and work rules.
    Union procedures, however, require approval by the
Firestone section of the union's International Policy
Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master
contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.
    The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package
by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the
limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and
off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude
the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would
permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and
Bloomington plants.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct
of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr
foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.
    Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said
last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public
sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected
Venezuela's improved credit image.
    "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot
be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said.
    Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory
committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor
from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to
1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.
    "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a
marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this
year," Lusinchi said.
    He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the
Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to
reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case,
because of the vulnerability of its economy."
    Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in
February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of
falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year.
    Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to
sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter,
but that in any case it would become effective from April 1.
    Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been
contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public
Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to
round up support.
    Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised
were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the
outlines of a government plan to allow public and private
sector debt capitalisation.
    He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans
to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord.
    "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now
have to define more precisely what projects can be financed
from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel
and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to
materialise.

countries are considering a U.S. proposal to set up a study
group to review the world copper market, delegates said.
    The U.S. initiative was introduced last December at a
meeting held here under the auspices of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
    The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second
biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to
improve statistics and market transparency of the copper
economy, and provide a forum for discussion.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
stabilise depressed world prices.
    This week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end
Friday.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said it
estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.
    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>PANTERA &lt;PANT> AND PIZZA &lt;PZA> AGREE TO MERGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, MO., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pantera's Corp said it agreed in
principle to acquire Pizza Inn Inc in a cash and stock
transaction.
    Under terms of the proposed transaction, each Pizza Inn
share can be exchanged for either three dlrs in cash plus the
lesser of 1.4 shares of Pantera's common stock or 11.50 dlrs
market value of Pantera's stock, or four dlrs in cash plus a
unit consisting of one share of Pantera's stock and a
non-transferrable right to receive up to 0.55 share of
Pantera's stock under certain conditions, it said.
    Completion of the transaction is subject to arrangement of
financing, negotiation of a definitive agreement, and various
regulatory approvals, it said.
    Pantera's said Pizza Inn's largest shareholder, F.J.
Spillman, previously granted Pantera's an option to buy more
than one mln shares of Pizza Inn common stock owned by him.
    Pantera's also said it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger.
Pizza Inn has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to act as its
financial advisor, Pantera's said.
    Yesterday, Pantera's stock closed at 9.50 dlrs on NASDAQ,
while Pizza Inn's stock was quoted at 12 dlrs when the Amex
halted trading pending the announcement of the proposed merger.
    From its Dallas headquarters, Pizza Inn said completion of
the transaction is subject to certain conditions including that
the price of Pantera's stock average not less than seven dlrs
during the 20 trading days before the merger.
    Under the agreement, Pizza Inn said it will still be
permitted to complete a leveraged buyout agreement with Pizza
Inn Acquiring Corp, which has been approved by its
shareholders, but is subject to otaining financing.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new
company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old
Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.
    The communique was issued after two days of talks here
between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and
Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.
    Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria
16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved,
but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in
world iron ore markets.
    Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be
decided after a project feasibility study. This would be
completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials
said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World
Bank, which is also expected to give financial support.
    Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year,
will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early
1990.
    On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for
uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed
that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to
cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and
silver.

<DATELINE>    RICHARDSON, Texas, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Electrospace Systems Inc said
it was ordered by the U.S. Army to immediately proceed with the
design and production of a computer-based control system for
the army's tactical voice and data communications network, in a
contract potentially worth 101 mln dlrs.
    It said the order followed a favorable ruling by the
General Accounting Office on two protests that earlier caused a
stop work order on the 26.8 mln dlr contract, awarded last
September. It said that order covers 59 mobile shelter-based
systems and 44 remote terminals, with options for 279 mobile
units and 178 remote units for a total of 101 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK TEAM ARRIVES IN UGANDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A World Bank team led by senior
economist Katrine Saito arrived in Uganda for talks on an
economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs
over three years.
    The four-member mission is expected to stay two to three
weeks. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is due here
over the same period, a World Bank offical said.
    The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on
deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues
likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery
program.
    Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most
of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating
industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors
and other agricultural needs.
    He did not say where the money would come from, but
diplomats expect the government to ask the World Bank and other
foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion.

lowered the ratings on Loral Corp's subordinated debt to BBB

    The issue is removed from creditwatch where it was placed
with negative implications in January after Loral said it
planned to acquire Goodyear Aerospace Corp for 640 mln dlrs.
    S/P said the acquisition enhances Loral's competitive
position in the defense electronics industry by broadening its
technology and program base. But most measures of financial

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LONDON OPTIONS MARKET SEES CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Stock Exchange's traded
options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year,
and will more than double the range of options available by the
end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain
said.
    He told a news conference that more options contracts were
traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's
existence.
    Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts
traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from
19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth
was expected.
    "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of
1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible
constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.
    Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be
introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc
&lt;SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc &lt;PLYL.L> from
March 19.
    The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United
States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two
currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an
option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.
    Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate
the London options market's leading position in Europe,
especially important with French and Swiss equity options
trading planned to start this year.
    "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are
conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting
continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least
the next year.
    He said much of the recent growth in options had come from
inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But
now the retail options market was beginning to take off.
    The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted
floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left
almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in
the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have
encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.
    Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to
equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a
final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.
    The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options
market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the
options market would need more than half of the available
space.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

<TITLE>BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world
textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could
react was to retaliate.
    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile
imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."
    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
U.S. trading partners.
    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
weakened by the Iran scandal.
    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we
could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."
    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes
on a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. We
have to avoid that."
    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
shipments of Asian textiles.
    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a
conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."
    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross
the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.
    "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two
big powers," De Croo said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press

will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade
bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
other countries their access to the American market would be
curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"
Rostenkowski said.
    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
American market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in the
market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House
last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for
foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face
a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

7,000 and 8,000 North American-made vehicles in Europe this
year, a five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-
president of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation said.
    "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told a
news briefing before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.
    "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in
Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later.
Officials said GM sold 1,500 North American-made vehicles in
the 1986 model year.

    Fry said at an average price of 13,000 dollars, his
projected sales figure for North American-made GM cars in
Europe would mean turnover of between 91 million and 104
million dollars.
    GM sales in Europe of North American-made cars in the 1985
model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive
prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said.
    The North American-made GM vehicles sold in Europe are
manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, with
most sales in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.

International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement
on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto
Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation,
said.
    "There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to
quotas," Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry
on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the
delegations.
    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set quotas.
    The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1
but the full council is not due to meet again until September.
"I am not optimistic about an agreement soon," Hesse said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
micrographics company.
    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
trading as high as seven earlier.
    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said.
"Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
integrate the company in the second half."
    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.
    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
a share.
    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
a share.
    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Export Credits Guarantee Department has
named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
years, to the post of executive director, a department
spokesman said.
    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
years.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
services.
    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
thing we want to take a look at."
    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"
Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
recipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removed
from the list.

<TITLE>OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
10.6 mln a year earlier.
    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
lard and tallow/greases.
    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
previous two seasons.
    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
demand.
    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee producing countries must quickly
map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
coffee exporters' association, said.
    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
plummet.
    However, he said the market should also take into account
evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
near totality of the Central American crop.
    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past
10 years.
    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand
the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations
as well as for industrialized countries.
    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
those debts, he said.
    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,
while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"
Cardenas said.

<DATELINE>    LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y. March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tender Loving Care Health Care
Services Inc said it and Staff Buildiers Inc have extended the
term of their merger agreement until May 31.
    Tender Loving Care also said &lt;Norrell Corp> agreed not to
acquire any additional Staff Builders shares until September
30, adding Norrell was paid 750,000 dlrs for the standstill
arrangement. 
    Tender Loving Care said it agreed to buy the 610,000 Staff
Builders common held by Norrell, about 19.1 pct of those
outstanding, for 6,950,000 dlrs immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement
continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for
each Staff Builders share outstanding.
    As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders
meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and
adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22.
    Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include
1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of
eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred.
    Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a
revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy
statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff
Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue
to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote
about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned
meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the
proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after
the record date for the meeting.
    In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own
about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of
the merger.
    Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the
outstanding shares will be required to approve the merger,
Tender Loving Care said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is
clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who
follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell
parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.
    But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers
whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands
of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and
replacement parts.
    Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many
opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's
intensified competition and the large volume of production in
North America planned by Japanese automakers.
    But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated
than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big
Three - General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.
    Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will
decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street
financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and
somewhat less so on Chrysler.
    And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the
industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its
sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable
parts-making businesses.

<TITLE>SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or
exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,
the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce
soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.
    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the
European Community and South America in the January/March
quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported
in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it
said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding
periods of 1986.
    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of
probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed
and large scale butter imports that were expected from March
onward, it said.
    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain
area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the
recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.
    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had
been bought recently by the Soviet Union.

   Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
increases.
    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
for special protection.
    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"
he said.
    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
proposed again this year.

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new
planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the
financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co &lt;BA> and
&lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said.
    "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the
manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and
Co. "They're called walkaway leases."
    AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus
but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,
which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.
    AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at
roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the
planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its
service in the Caribbean and to Europe.
    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the
planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.
The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year
extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days
notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman
Robert Crandall.
    "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"
Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off
balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the
financing is provided by the manufacturers.
    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own
the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said.
Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,
long-range A300-600 planes.
    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of
Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part
of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.
    Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before
by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of
planes, but not to this extent.
    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will
give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the
manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and
consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into
the early 1990s," he said.
    "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will
increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to
reduce their exposure to risk, he added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund  said
it approved 125.9 mln SDR's to assist development in Jamaica.
    Of this total, 85 mln SDR's can be drawn over the next 15
months under a standby arrangement in support of the
government's economic and financial program.
    Another 40.9 mln is available immediately under the
compensatory financing facility, the IMF's pool of funds to
assist countries hit by export shortfalls. The IMF said that
Jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due to
reduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures.
    After some deterioration, the situation and prospects for
Jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly
as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates,
and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.
    The program that the new funding supports is designed to
continue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as to
achieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and a
balance of payments viability in the medium term.

it will not establish further free-standing ovum transfer
centers and is exploring the establishment of general fertility
centers and alternative businesses.
    The company said this followed its evaluation of
unpublished technical information regarding some competing
technology which, if substantiated and replicated, could
adversely affect the company's operations.
    Fertility and Genetics said the non-surgical ovum transfer
procedure will continue to remain a viable option for infertile
couples to consider among the several alternative procedures
available in advanced reproductive medicine.
    "In particular, it is medically and psychologically
superior to surrogate motherhood, because the fertilized egg is
transferred prior to the gestation process, rather than after
maternal bonding with the child has taken place," the company
explained without further reference to the unpublished
technical information.

<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hewlett Packard Co said it
unveiled the HP LaserJet Series II printer, the next generation
of its laser printer line.
    The company said the HP LaserJet II offers more
capabilities than earlier models, but at 2,495 dlrs, costs 500
dlrs less than previous machines. The LaserJet II prints eight
pages a minute and can be used for desktop publishing, word
processing, and spreadsheet and graphics printing.
    It also said it introduced a larger laser printer to
accommodate numerous workstations and a machine used to scan
documents.
    The company also said it introduced the HP LaserJet 2000,
its first printer designed to be used with personal computer
networks, departmental systems and minicomputers. It can print
20 pages a minute, and has an entry price of 19,995 dlrs.
    It also unveiled the SP ScanJet, a flatbed desktop device 
that scans printed images of text. The scanner works like a
photocopier storing the copied images on a hard disk, the
company said. It costs 1,495 dlrs.
    Hewlett Packard also said it brought out a new family of
plotter machines, the HP Draftmasters I and II. The new models
replace the HP 758X series of drafting-plotter line machines
used for computer aided design. The Draftmaster costs 9,900
dlrs, and the Draftsmaster II, 11,900 dlrs.
    A smaller plotter, called the DraftPro, was priced at 5,400
dlrs. It is designed for use with a personal computer.

<TITLE>PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent heavy rains have not affected the
Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record
harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative
groups said.
    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of
cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,
told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)
was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101
quintales in the year to September 1986.
    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood
waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the
crop was unaffected.
    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa
Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last
year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.
    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if
they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.
    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this
year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,
assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.
    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members
last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another
235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO
members.

<TITLE>GAO SAYS FSLIC SHOWS DEFICIT, NEEDS FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential
liability from insolvent savings associations, the General
Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing.
    "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to 
establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion
dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near
future," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.
    "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLIC
would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end
of 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the
large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations
that continue to operate," Wolf said.
    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's
plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize
FSLIC.
    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC
insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were
insolvent.
    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,
earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three
quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations
lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.
    The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.
    Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight
billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings
associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said
are considered "hopelessly insolvent".

<TITLE>GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of General Electric Co's biggest
businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
Wall Street analysts said.
    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said
Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, Heymann said.
    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, Heymann noted.
    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock."
    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
order "will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.
    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK> CONTINUES DRIVE INTO NEW MARKETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co, best known for its
cameras and film products, took several steps today to boost
its image as a diversified information systems company.
    The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new
electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast
computerized libraries of documents and pictures.
    Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging
market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach
five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may
pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.
    Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to
promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market
what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J.
Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business
imaging systems division.
    While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in
sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales
of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business
products will exceed four billion dlrs this year.
    "We're launching a major attack on these new markets,"
Greco said.
    "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its
bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.
    But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and
Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer
on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer
photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a
profit," he said.
     Kodak also announced the first commerically available
14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store the
equivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>French exporters estimated that around
600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for
delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.
    Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July
1986 and February this year.
    Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during
this month and around the same amount in April, they said.
    France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in
1985/86, according to customs figures.
    However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of
its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of
U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January
and making some purchases under the initiative.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD SEES BRAZIL LENDING PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with
commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and
Brazil.
    "This should result in substantial new lending for the
major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the
Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the
U.S. House of Representatives.
    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new
financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,
Mulford said.
    "We are concerned about the backlog of other financial
packages and would like to see these move ahead soon," he said,
"There is some evidence that this is already happening.
    Chile signed an agreement with banks last week, and there
was also an agreement with Venezuela on rescheduling principal
payments on previously renegotiated debt.
    "We look for rapid progress in commercial bank discussions
with Argentina, the Philippines, and ultimately Brazil," he
said.

Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in
aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto
salon.
    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9
sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet
aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for
Bertone's steel-structured sports cars.
    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in
Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association.
     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum
structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto
making methods and plants.
    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a
car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and
performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It
said the structures also provide long life without the need for
rust protection.
    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as
present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65
pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.

<TITLE>F.W. WOOLWORTH'S &lt;Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gail Appleson, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The specialty retailing area continues
to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and
dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
ago.
    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
income generated by the company's specialty store operations
accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
which 1,200 are in the United States.
    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as
they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."
    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
period.
    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
than general merchandise stores.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily
indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease
their debt burden.
    "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity
or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt
relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with
measures to encourage new equity investment and the
repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee
on International Development Institutions.
    Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to
the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging
from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions
for lending.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.
    He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective
because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,
create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can
help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

<TITLE>CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian economic growth is expected to
slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,
deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number."
    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she
added.
    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the
federal agency said in a statement.
    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen and Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England proposed that banks
in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization
to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.
    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of
credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they
lead manage.
    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative
paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and
deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.
    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond
securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of
new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by
Euromoney magazine.
    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead
managing eurobond issues.
    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of
England is concerned about intense competition for market share
which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to
imprudent credit risk.
    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as
banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules
suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as
regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk
than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of
England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to
accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters
act prudently.
    "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's
lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill
and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market
concerned...," the Bank's proposal said.
    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead
underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the
face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60
pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it
must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of
capital.
    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of
28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After
that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be
assessed at their full face value.
    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,
revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.
    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen
its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called
for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their
possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned
final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.
    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the
third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the
supervision of financial institutions.
    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,
aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building
Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing
with banks.
    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between
recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal
controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.
    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in
advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their
capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10
and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.
    However, preliminary consultations with bank
representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be
flawed, it said.
    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a
case-by-case basis rather than along general lines.
    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of
exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other
units of their own group of companies, the paper showed.
    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to
local governments and other public sector entities, and of
exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.
    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as
collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.
    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their
own group of companies would usually be looked into on a
case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.
    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and
other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should
be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments
provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.
    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and
those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee
Department would probably not qualify for such treatment.
    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of
another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling
could be exceeded in individual cases.
    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking
to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state
in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's
balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.
    On collateral security, it said this "should normally only
be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a
bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."
    "The presence of security taken on its own will be
considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure
in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional
circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. TO OFFER MISSILE TREATY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the United
States would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile
reductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow.
    Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the
White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max
Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for
consultations later this week. He said they will then return to
Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact.
    Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday
to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces
(INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said:
"This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF
reductions."
    "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our
negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text
at Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said.
    He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to
be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet
missiles, "none is more important than verification ... Any
agreement must be effectively verifiable."
    The United States has been working closely with allies and
friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on
reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual
elimination, the president said.
     He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed
upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in
Reykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leader
insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on
long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.
    "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said.
    He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage
of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to
agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the
earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

<TITLE>GOODYEAR &lt;GT> CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES CORPORATE RAIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that "terrorists in three-piece suits" are undermining
the nation's industrial base.
In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,
Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on."
    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
Mercer said.
    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.
    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down
three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
payroll by 10 pct, he said.
    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing
on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
takeovers have also hurt workers.

<TITLE>SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet winter grains could be off to
a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
for E.F. Hutton said.
    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
USDA analyst said.
    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.
    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
entire winter crop area, she said.
    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.
    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
a half," Martell said.

    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to

<TITLE>OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.
    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales," Margoshes said.
    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
December pact is falling apart.
    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally."
    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
North sea crude oil market.
    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    "The production probably is about their quota level and
largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result," Margoshes said.
    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    But others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.
